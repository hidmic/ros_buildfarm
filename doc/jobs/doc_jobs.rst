*doc* jobs
==============

A *doc* job is used for generating API documentation as well as extracting
information from the package manifests.


Different types of documentation
--------------------------------

Each *doc build files* can have one of four specific documentation types:

* the **rosdoc_lite** type operates on doc repositories.
  For each *doc build file* with that type a separate Jenkins view is created.
  Each *doc* job operates on a specific branch of a single doc repository and
  is triggered based on a timer (once every few days).
  After a partial build step (more about this see below) it uses
  `rosdoc_lite <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdoc_lite>`_ to run
  various tools for the generation step.

* the **released_manifest** type operates on the released packages.
  For each *doc build file* with that type a separate Jenkins job is created.
  It operates on all released packages for which no doc entry is present in the
  ROS distribution file.
  The information from the package manifest is extracted to be used in the ROS
  wiki.

* the **make_target** type operates on independent repositories.
  For each *doc build file* with that type a separate Jenkins job is created.
  For each repository a simple **make doc** command is executed which must
  honor an environment variable identifying the destination of the generated
  documentation.

* the **docker_build** type also operates on independent repositories.
  For each *doc build file* with that type a Jenkins job is created.
  Each repository must provide its own Dockerfile below `docker/image/`,
  taking and enforcing *user* and *uid* arguments appropriately.
  Provided containers are expected to **generate and commit** content to
  the upload git repository mounted at $SITE when run with no arguments,
  potentially using their own repository content mounted at $REPO.

There is no specific diagram showing the correlation between the various
scripts and templates but they follow the same naming scheme as the *release*
and *devel* jobs.


Entry points
------------

The following scripts are the entry points for *doc* jobs.
The scripts operate on a specific *doc build file* in the ROS build farm
configuration:

* **generate_doc_maintenance_jobs.py** generates a set of jobs on the farm
  which will perform maintenance tasks.

  * The ``reconfigure-jobs`` job will (re-)configure the *doc* jobs with the
    type *rosdoc_lite* for each repository on a regular basis (e.g. once every
    day).
  * The ``trigger-jobs`` job is triggered manually to trigger *doc* jobs with
    the type *rosdoc_lite* selected by their current build status.

* related to the **rosdoc_lite** type:

  * **generate_doc_jobs.py** invokes *generate_doc_job.py* for every doc
    repository matching the criteria from the *doc build file*.
  * **generate_doc_job.py** generates a *doc* jobs for a
    specific doc repository for the platform and architecture listed in the
    *doc build file*.
  * **generate_doc_script.py** generates a *shell* script which will run the
    same tasks as the *doc* job for a specific doc repository on a local
    machine.

* related to the **released_manifest** type:

  * **generate_doc_metadata_job.py** generates a job which extracts the
    information from all releases packages matching the criteria from the
    *doc build file*.

* related to the **make_target** and **docker_build** types:

  * **generate_doc_independent_job.py** generates a job which either invokes
    a custom *doc* target on all repositories listed in the *doc build file*
    OR runs source-side containers as provided by each repository listed in
    the same file, respectively.

The build process in detail
---------------------------

In order to generate API documentation for certain languages the source code
for ROS messages etc. must be generated.
In order to avoid performing a full build the CMakeLists.txt file provided by
each package is replaced with a mock.
The mock CMake file will search for ROS message definitions in the recommended
locations and perform the generation step if the package depends on the
necessary generators.
The actual build is performed within a Docker container in order to only make
the declared dependencies available.


Known limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several limitations result from the naive approach to simplify the build step:

* Packages which perform custom logic in the CMakeLists.txt file to e.g. fetch
  additional content at configure / build time can't be documented as expected
  since the mock CMake file is not replicating the custom logic.

* Message files in non-standard locations will not be recognised and therefore
  no code will be generated for them.

* Message files in standard location will be recognised even if they are not
  being used in the original CMake file of the package.


Run the *doc* job locally
-------------------------

In order to use ``ros_buildfarm`` locally you need to
`setup your environment <../environment.rst>`_ with the necessary Python
packages.

The entry point ``generate_doc_script.py`` can be used to generate a shell
script which will perform the same tasks as the build farm.
It requires certain tools to be available on the local machine (e.g. the Python
packages ``catkin_pkg``, ``rosdistro``).

When the generated script is being invoked in runs the *generate documentation*
task in a Docker container.


Example invocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following commands run the *doc* job for the *roscpp_core* repository from
ROS *Indigo* for Ubuntu *Trusty* *amd64*:

.. code:: sh

  mkdir /tmp/doc_job
  generate_doc_script.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config/production/index.yaml indigo default roscpp_core ubuntu trusty amd64 > /tmp/doc_job/doc_job_indigo_roscpp_core.sh
  cd /tmp/doc_job
  sh doc_job_indigo_roscpp_core.sh
